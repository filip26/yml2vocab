# Previewing PR-s

This is a temporary setup for the Verifiable Credentials Working Group. That WG uses this script extensively to generate vocabularies. However, the effective generation of these vocabulary is done via github actions, which makes it difficult to preview the results when a Pull Request is created with changes in the vocabularies. Instead of requiring the reviewer to generate the vocabulary files locally, this directory is used to store a specific PR preview temporarily.

- [Verifiable Credentials Vocabulary](./vcdm/)
- [Security Vocabulary](./di/)
- [Bitstring Status List](./sl)
